# RomiReference

Coach Mike added this text.

This is forked from https://github.com/robotpy/examples/tree/main/RomiReference

This repo python source code based upon [RobotPy](https://robotpy.github.io/docs/) - [RobotPy at readthedocs.io](https://robotpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) -
code for the [Romi]( https://github.com/robotpy/examples/tree/main/RomiReference).

Robotpy add a Python programming environment to the [WPILib](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/) software
development environment for [FRC](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) robots, for Python development. Prior to robotpy, FRC
robots were programmed in C++ or Java.

## TL;DR

For those in the "too long; didn't read" camp, here are the steps to get Python program, using RobotPy and WPILib,
controlling an Romi.  These instructions are for a Windows PC, but similar steps should work on a Linux computer or
a Mac.


### Steps

* [Download and install wpilib](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases) - TODO need to verify this step is needed with RobotPy
* Follow **some** of the steps in https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/Romi-robot/hardware-and-imaging.html and https://Romiusersguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/course/building.html
  * Note 1: If you follow the complete video, it uses [Romi Code from WPI (https://Romicode.wpi.edu/)](https://Romicode.wpi.edu/) 
    to test out the robot build. Which is a different development environment than
    the [FRC Control System](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/) development environment firmware that these steps
    load into the Romi.
  * Note 2: Follow the [steps](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/romi-robot/index.html):
    * Getting Started with Romi
      * Romi Hardware, Assembly and Imaging
      * Getting to know your Romi
      * Romi Hardware Support
      * The Romi Web UI
      * But stop before "Programming the Romi"
* Make sure your computer is reconnected to the internet and not your Romi
* [Download and install Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3122/)
* Download this repo from https://github.com/spiresfrc9106/romiReferencePython
  * If you downloaded as a zip file, unzip into a directory
  * Open a Windows PowerShell Window
    * Because RobotPy uses the `pyproject.toml` that is in `romiReferencePython` the Change directory (cd) to the directory where you downloaded and perhaps unzip `romiReferencePython`:
       ```commandline
       cd C:\Users\MikeStitt\Downloads\first\sw\romiReferencePython
       ```

       ```commandline
       pwd
       ```
    
       results in:

      ```commandline
       Path
       ----
       C:\Users\MikeStitt\Downloads\first\sw\romiReferencePython 
       ```
       for reference, a dir command
       ```commandline
       dir
       ```

       results in something like this:

       ```commandline

       Directory: C:\Users\MikeStitt\Downloads\first\sw\romiReferencePython

       Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name

       ```
    * Verify that your Python command is python 
       ```commandline
       python -VV
       Python 3.12.1 (tags/v3.12.1:2305ca5, Dec  7 2023, 22:03:25) [MSC v.1937 64 bit (AMD64)]
       ```
    * Install RobotPy
      ```commandline
      python -m pip install --upgrade pip
      python -m pip install robotpy
      python -m pip install robotpy-halsim-ws --use-deprecated=legacy-resolver
      ```
      
    * The above results in an error message like:
      ```commandline
      <- SNIP ->
      
      ERROR: pip's legacy dependency resolver does not consider dependency conflicts when selecting packages. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.

    * From the `romiReferencePython` directory, do a RobotPy sync:
      ```commandline

      python -m robotpy sync

      ```
  * Connect a **wired-only USB** xbox controller to your PC. This can be confusing because some xbox controllers have
    a USB connector for charging, but are **wireless** xbox controller. These will not work. Logitech xbox controllers
    will work, if the switch on the back of them are switched to the "X" mode using the  "X" or "D" switch on the back
    of the controller.
  * Powerup the Romi
  * Connect to the Romi WiFi network
    * The network SSID is something like `SSID WPILibPi-<number>` (where `<number>` is based on the Raspberry Pi serial number) with the WPA2 passphrase `WPILib2021!`.
  * TODO add the steps the first time you power-up your Romi using `http://10.0.0.2/`
  * Go back to your Windows PowerShell Window.
    * This step can be confusing for those that know how to simulate and deploy to full-sized FRC robots. Use RobotPy to
      launch the WPILib simulator to control the Romi from the Windows PowerShell that is in the `romiReferencePython` directory:
      ```commandline
      python -m robotpy sim --ws-client
      ```
      resulting in:
      ```commandline

## The robot website

On a simulator
- http://localhost:5805/

On a RoboRIO
- http://10.91.6.2:5805/
- Be sure that you are connected to the RoboRIO's network via WiFi or Ethernet

## Deploying to the Robot

Use the `WPILib: Deploy Robot Code` task in VSCode's command palette.

OR

`robotpy deploy` will deploy all code to the robot. Be sure to be on the robot's network via WiFi or Ethernet.

### Deploy Notes

`robotpy deploy --skip-tests` to avoid requiring tests to pass before deployment can proceed. This is helpful for quick iterations, but don't make it a bad habit.

`.deploy_cfg` contains specific configuration about the deploy process.

Any folder or file prefixed with a `.` will be skipped in the deploy. This is good to avoid sending unnecessary files to the resource limited RoboRIO like documentation and images.

## Linting

"Linting" is the process of checking our code format and style to keep it looking nice and avoid unnecessary inconsistencies.

`pylint --rcfile=.pylintrc **\*.py`

`.pylintrc` contains configuration about what checks the linter runs, and what formatting it enforces

## Testing

Run the `WPILib: Test Robot Code` task in VSCode's command palette.

OR

`robotpy test`

## Simulating

Run the `WPILib: Simulate Robot Code` task in VSCode's command palette.

OR

`robotpy sim`

## RIO First-time Installation

Follow [the robotpy instructions for setting up the RIO](https://robotpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/robot.html)

Then, install all packages specific to our repo, from `requirements_dev.txt`, following the
[two step process for roboRIO package installer](https://robotpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/packages.html)

While on the internet:

`python -m robotpy_installer download -r requirements_dev.txt`

Then, while connected to the robot's network:

```cmd
python -m robotpy_installer install-python
python -m robotpy_installer install robotpy
python -m robotpy_installer list
```

To check what is installed:

`python -m robotpy_installer list`

example output:
```cmd

## Dependency Management

`requirements_dev.txt` is used to list dependencies that we only need on our development computers, not on the RoboRIO. This is tools like linting and formatting; they aren't mission critical (or even used) at runtime, but still very helpful to have.

`pyproject.toml` defines the dependencies that are required to be installed on the RoboRIO for our code to successfully run. For tests and simulations you will also need these dependencies on your development machine. They are managed automatically via `robotpy sync`.

## Useful commands:

See network logs: `python -m netconsole roboRIO-9106-frc.local`

SSH into the robot: `ssh lvuser@roboRIO-9106-frc.local`

## Roborio 2.0 image install

Use balenaEtcher to install the roborio image

The 2023 roborio 2.0 image is here:

C:\Program Files (x86)\National Instruments\LabVIEW 2020\project\roboRIO Tool\FRC Images\SD Images

The 2024 roboio 2.0 image is here:

C:\Program Files (x86)\National Instruments\LabVIEW 2023\project\roboRIO Tool\FRC Images\SD Images

use roborio team number setter to set the team number

Todo add a link to https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/romi-robot/index.html

https://github.com/wpilibsuite/WPILibPi

https://github.com/RPi-Distro/pi-gen

so far this has not worked: https://raspberrypihq.com/how-to-add-wifi-to-the-raspberry-pi/


To install photon vision, connect pi over ethernet, `ssh pi@wpilibpi.local`, first follow these instructions:

https://docs.photonvision.org/en/latest/docs/installation/sw_install/romi.html

Then these instructions:

https://docs.photonvision.org/en/latest/docs/installation/sw_install/other-coprocessors.html

Then use web browser at `pilibpi.local` to set filesystem to be writeable.

Then `sudo systemctl restart photonvision.service`

Then the this `http://10.0.0.2:5800/#/dashboard` is available.  But see: `https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/romi-photonvision-startup-errors/452444/7` for the problem we are having

Perhaps this pull request: `https://github.com/wpilibsuite/WPILibPi/pull/233`

It might be good to compare this working Romi tag: `https://github.com/wpilibsuite/WPILibPi/releases/tag/v2023.2.1` to the latest
and to the pull request.

```commandline
http://10.0.0.2/
```

```commandline
ssh pi@wpilibpi.local

or

```commandline
ssh pi@10.0.0.2
```

password: `raspberry`

```commandline
cat /etc/os-release
